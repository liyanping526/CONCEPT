            <h2>Sunset Park</h2>
            <p> In the 1950s, there were 1,820 Puerto Ricans living in Sunset Park; by 1970, this number had grown to nearly 24,000.  As with all new groups coming to Sunset Park, they settled along the waterfront, in residences vacated by their escalating predecessors. where they took up jobs in the industrials center of the neighborhood.  Puerto Ricans at first mainly lived along 3rd Avenue, which had been neglected since the construction of the Gowanus Expressway had ruined the commerce along the avenue.  As they settled in and became a larger proportion of the population, Puerto Ricans formed various social clubs–such as Moca, Hatillo, and Camuy–based on the town from which they had migrated; also, in 1966 the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park was formed to help citizens in the community.</p><br>
            <p>Sunset Park’s status as a now-diminished Scandinavian neighborhood, and its more recent status as a Chinese neighborhood are more publicized, but the area has also been heavily Latinx for several decades especially the further west you go. Not mentioned very much is a Mexican pocket centered along 7th Avenue in the mid-40s, with storefronts featuring the Mexican flag colors. The storefront at right refers to Our Lady of Guadalupe, a vision of Mary that appeared to a Mexican Indian near what became Mexico City in 1521.</p><br>
            <p>The immigrant experience is the heart and soul of the neighborhood, now more than ever, in cause and in effect. I think of the first ferries of produce to and from Manhattan as I wait for the Sunset Park Greenmarket to return. The best thing about visiting the market, even better than the produce, is seeing the flamenco dancers. The best thing about visiting Sunset Park is even better than its history alone: the most important pieces of its history are still alive and shaping its present, while newcomers who still need or want a life here are welcomed in</p><br>
